1. download docker, nodeJS, python 3
2. run `docker-compose up` in the root folder to start the app
3. Double-check localhost:3000 for frontend, and localhost:8080/health to see if backend server is running
4. Write .env values (check our private chat for the .env values!)
5. HAVE FUN and put up PRs for your features!
6. If you want to rebuild, you can run `docker-compose down` to stop the docker containers.
7. Can also run `docker-compose build --no-cache` if you want to build the containers again with no cache!
